# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Charlie, and I'm addicted to making things. 

However...

That doesn't mean that I actually ***know*** how to make things.

I ***do***, however, like learning how to make new things, so this wiki is my attempt at documenting all the different things I've learned over the years. 

The process of finding all the various resources to learn a new topic can be tedious, and I'm hoping that compiling this wiki makes the process quicker and less painful for others looking to learn the same things I have!

# How to use this wiki

I have learned a lot over the past couple years, but that does not mean that I'm an expert at anything. In fact, I would probably say I'm "ok" at a lot of things but not "great" at really anything. Except maybe deleting some puppy chow. Man I love puppy chow...

In any case, don't take anything in this wiki as the iron truth. The goal of this wiki is not to ***teach you how to do everything***, but rather to ***share the resources I used to learn something***.

I plan on using this site for my own purposes, but if other people find it useful, that's great!

You can find the various topics I've attempted over the past couple years 

Thats all for now, enjoy!
